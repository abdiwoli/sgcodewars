A couple of notes on these:
@Yang went for the lambda and paid the price 
@Vanessa G. prefers one liners that calculate the same variables per each iteration of the loop and she should stop doing that 
@Kurt Hinderer's algorithm is a little slower because he calculated all the factors with an integer division instead of casting the number to a string. Great to see an alternative and being able to compare the performance
