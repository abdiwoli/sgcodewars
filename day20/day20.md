* For this kata, simplicity was the key, just counting the parenthesis was enough and that is what the fastest solutions do, either buy appending them to a list or just summing up.
* A note for @Akash Karanâ€™s solution, which is something you will find very often. In case of a very large string of characters, with an invalid closing parenthesis, his code will be faster, simply because it stops the processing immediately. This shows the limitations of my analysis, since I'm not using different inputs. A more complete analysis would have corner cases, valid cases and exceptions. (edited)
